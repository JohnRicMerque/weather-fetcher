### Personal Modifications
I made some modifications such as:
* adding heat index and wind speed
* country initials to specify exact location, in case of places with same name
* looping the program to check other cities in a single run, and asks for loop exit as well
* visual aesthetics

### What I learned
This program introduced me on how to use API's as tools to have necessary resources to build a program. In the process I also used the requests module to send HTTP requests using Python. I learned that the HTTP request returns a response object with all the response data that can be used for the program.

### Application of Learned Concepts
Learning the concept of APIs will be useful in building different types of programs. To reference built-in resources will help me have the materials I need in case I want to build something. Moreover, learning the requests module will be helpful in retrieving resources from the web and will be very useful in the future. For example I would want to build something that needs a Facebook data API, then I can retrieve those data and I can freely use them.
